# Guess The Number Game
This JavaFX application, "Guess The Number Game," is a simple interactive game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is too low, too high, or correct. The player has the option to start a new game with a different random number or try again after successfully guessing the correct number.
